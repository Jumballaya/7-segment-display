# 7 Segment Display Component

This is the code repository for the 7 Segment Display Component I created. In the code folder there is the example code used in the post detailing how to prototype, design and build a custom component.

The component is made up of an 8-bit shift register (74HC595) and a 7 segment display. It was chosen because I wanted a simple project to explore designing a custom PCB and having it printed.
